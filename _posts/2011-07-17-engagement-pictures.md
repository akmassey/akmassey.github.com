# Engagement Pictures
## Posted by Aaron on 17 July 2011

There are few easy decisions in wedding planning.  However, for us, the
choice of photographer was one of those rare wedding decisions we were
able to make quickly and confidently.  We've known Samantha Maxwell for
several years.  Her husband, Jeremy is a graduate student in Aaron's
research group.  We've both enjoyed following her photography blog, and
now our [engagement pictures are featured on
it](http://samanthamaxwellphoto.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/aaron-allison-engaged/).

We ended up shooting pictures in two separate sessions, both of which
were rather warm summer days in Raleigh.  I'm not sure how Samantha
managed to make us look like we weren't simply sweltering out there
given the heat.  Definitely poke around her other posts while you're
there.  She has some really fun and creative pictures.
