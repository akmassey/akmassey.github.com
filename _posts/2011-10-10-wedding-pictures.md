# Wedding Pictures
## Posted by Aaron on 10 October 2011

Whew!  We survived the wedding!  Unfortunately, and I've definitely been
a little remiss in updating our wedding website.  I apologize.  It's
been a rather crazy almost two months, and I hope to post more soon, but
for not I have one quick update for everyone:

Our [wedding pictures][1] are up!

If you're interested in seeing them, dive right in.  If you're
interested in purchasing them, then we recommend getting them from
SmugMug since they produce professional prints.

Enjoy!
