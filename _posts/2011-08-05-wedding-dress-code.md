# Wedding Dress Code
## Posted by Aaron on 5 August 2011

A couple of folks have asked what to wear to the wedding.  It's a fair
question, and we didn't really specify anything directly on the
invitations.  

Allison and I aren't particularly formal people.  We're more interested
in seeing you than seeing your nicest possible getup.  Thus, the wedding
will be more of a "come as you are" event than not.  Having said that,
it's still a wedding.  Some folks would actually feel uncomfortable if
they weren't wearing semi-formal attire.  We don't want that.

Thus, our recommendation is to wear something that would qualify as
"dressy casual" without making you feel uncomfortable while eating BBQ.
If you don't feel comfortable at a wedding with something less formal
than a suit or a dress, then feel free to wear those.  However, if you
would feel more comfortable wearing business casual clothes, then you're
more than welcome to do so.
