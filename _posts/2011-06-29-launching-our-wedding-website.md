# Launching Our Wedding Website
## Posted by Aaron on 29 June 2011

Allison and I are extremely pleased to be launching our wedding website!
To those who have waited patiently for it, I apologize for the delay.
If you're interested in following along as we prepare for the wedding,
and more importantly for our marriage, then I would encourage you to
[subscribe to our updates][Feed].  If you're not sure what that means,
then I recommend [eHow's introduction to RSS Feeds][eHow].

You may be wondering what sort of things we will be putting on this
website in the future.  We're planning on adding pictures, thoughts
about where we are in the planning process, and perhaps some reflections
on the past.  We will definitely post an update if we add or change
anything in the main website.  If you're interested in how the website
was made, please see our [colophon page][colophon].

That's all for now.  Enjoy the website!
