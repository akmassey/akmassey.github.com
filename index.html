<h1>This is not the site you were looking for...</h1>

<p>I sincerely doubt that this site will contain anything useful for you, but I'm creating it anyhow so that I can play with Jekyll.</p>

<h1>News and Updates</h1>
<ul class="posts">
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		<li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="/{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	{% endfor %}
 </ul>
