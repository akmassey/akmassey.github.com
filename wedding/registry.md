# The Wedding Registry

We're an incredibly lucky, blessed couple in many ways.  There aren't
many things that we truly need.  As a result, we urge you to consider
supporting any of the following organizations in lieu of a wedding gift:

* [Fellowship Raleigh] --- Aaron and Allison are members of Fellowship
  Raleigh, a church plant dedicated to making passionate disciples of
  Jesus Christ who love God, one another, and the world.  We would both be
  honored by any supporting gift given to our young church as it
  desires to positively impact the city of Raleigh.
* [Poplar Forest] --- Poplar Forest was Thomas Jefferson's second home,
  now designated a National Historic Landmark and operated as a museum.
  Aaron and Allison visited Poplar Forest and fell in love with the place.
  You can [read more about their visit](http://wheretheresallison.blogspot.com/2010/12/poplar-forest.html) on Allison's blog.
* [The Gideons International] --- The Gideons are an organization
  dedicated to distributing Bibles and evangelism. Aaron's father was a
  Gideon for many years, and he would particularly appreciate any
  donations to this organization.

If you choose to donate, please contact us to let us know.  We would
like to be able to properly thank anyone who chooses to support these
organizations.
