# About Fellowship Raleigh

Before Allison moved to Raleigh, she began looking for churches online.
One immediately caught her eye because it was a church plant, much like
the church she was coming from.  She contacted the pastor, asked a few
questions, and found out they were having a service Easter Sunday, a few
weeks after she moved there.

We went to the Easter service and were both impressed with the welcoming
and friendly people we met and the passion everyone had for this small
church plant.  We never visited another church after that and have been
at Fellowship Raleigh ever since.  Aaron runs the sound on Sundays and
Allison helps out with making coffee and running PowerPoint back in the
A/V booth with Aaron.
