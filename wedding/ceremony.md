# About Fellowship Raleigh

Before Allison moved to Raleigh, she began looking for churches online.
One immediately caught her eye because it was a church plant, much like
the church she was coming from.  She contacted the pastor, asked a few
questions, and found out they were having a service Easter Sunday, a few
weeks after she moved there.

We went to the Easter service, which was hosted at the [Comedy
Worx](http://comedyworx.com/) building.  We were both impressed with the
welcoming and friendly people we met and the passion everyone had for
this small church plant.  We never visited another church after that and
have been at [Fellowship Raleigh](http://www.fellowshipraleigh.org) ever
since.  Aaron runs the sound on Sundays and Allison helps out with
making coffee and running PowerPoint back in the A/V booth with Aaron.
