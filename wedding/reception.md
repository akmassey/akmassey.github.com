# Our Need for BBQ

Rudyâ€™s BBQ --- Beef brisket that is cut from the pit right in front of you
and served on butcher paper with some white bread and pickles.  What
more could you ask for?

The Salt Lick

Texas barbecue is best.  It is beef, brisket usually, and smoked
sausage.  Sauce very optional.

Carolina BBQ is second best.  It is pork with vinegar sauce.

A discussion of the best BBQ places we've been, and a comparison of
North Carolina and Texas BBQ.
