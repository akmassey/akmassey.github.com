# What is a Colophon?

A colophon is a brief description of how something was made.  It has
long been used as a publishing term, which you can read about more on
[its Wikipedia page][colophon].

# Why did you build your own wedding website?

Ah, how many times have I wondered that over the last few weeks and
months?  It certainly would have been easier to use a prebuilt,
prethemed website from [The Knot](http://theknot.com), but then neither
of us would have learned anything.
